# Source code for Svelte Tutorials at MDN Web docs

Source code of the To-Do list app for the Svelte tutorials at [Understanding client-side JavaScript frameworks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks#Svelte_tutorials) series at MDN Web docs.

Each article has it's correspondent folder with the source code to follow the tutorial.

To get the source files you have to clone the repository, like this:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/opensas/mdn-svelte-tutorial.git
```

> Note: If you just want to download the files without cloning the git repo, you can use the [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) tool like this `npx degit opensas/mdn-svelte-tutorial`. You can also download a specific folder with `npx degit opensas/mdn-svelte-tutorial/01-getting-started`.

Then to get the app running, cd into the article's folder, and run the following commands:

```
cd 01-getting-started
npm install
npm run dev
```

We also provide a Svelte REPL for each article, as listed below, so that you can just start coding online without having to install anything on your desktop.

## 01. Getting started with Svelte

In this article we'll provide a quick introduction to the [Svelte framework](https://svelte.dev/). We will see how Svelte works and what sets it apart from the rest of the frameworks and tools we've seen so far. Then we will learn how to setup our development environment, create a sample app, understand the structure of the project, and see how to run it locally and build it for production.

You can see the complete content of this article [here](./01-getting-started/Svelte_getting_started.md) or at [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Svelte_getting_started).

## 02. Starting our To-Do list app

Now that we have a basic understanding of how things work in Svelte, we can start building our example app: a todo list. In this article we will first have a look at the desired functionality of our app, then we'll create a `Todos.svelte` component and put static markup and styles in place, leaving everything ready to start developing our To-Do list app features, which we'll go on to in subsequent articles.

You can see the complete content of this article [here](./02-starting-our-todo-app/Svelte_starting_our_todo_app.md) or at [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Svelte_todo_list_beginning).

## 03. Adding dynamic behavior: working with variables and props

Now that we have our markup and styles ready we can start developing the required features for our Svelte To-Do list app. In this article we'll be using variables and props to make our app dynamic, allowing us to add and delete todos, mark them as complete, and filter them by status.

You can see the complete content of this article [here](./03-adding-dynamic-behavior/Svelte_adding_dynamic_behavior.md) or at [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Svelte_variables_props).

## 04. Componentizing our Svelte app

The central objective of this article is to look at how to break our app into manageable components and share information between them. We'll componentize our app, then add more functionality to allow users to update existing components.

You can see the complete content of this article [here](./04-componentizing-our-app/Svelte_componentizing_our_app.md) or at [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Svelte_components).

## 05. Svelte advanced concepts

In this article we will add the app's final features and further componentize our app. We will learn how to deal with reactivity issues related to updating objects and arrays. To avoid common pitfalls, we'll have to dig a little deeper into Svelte's reactivity system. We'll also look at solving some accessibility focus issues, and more besides.

## 06. Working with Svelte stores

In this article we will show another way to handle state management in Svelte â€” [Stores](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/writable-stores). Stores are global global data repositories that hold values. Components can subscribe to stores and receive notifications when their values change. We will also see how to develop our own custom store to persist the todos information to local storage.

You can see the complete content of this article [here](./06-stores/Svelte_stores.md) or at [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Svelte_stores).

## 07. TypeScript support in Svelte

We will now learn how to use TypeScript in Svelte applications. First we'll learn what TypeScript is and what benefits it can bring us. Then we'll see how to configure our project to work with TypeScript files. Finally we will go over our app and see what modifications we have to make to fully take advantage of TypeScript features.

You can see the complete content of this article [here](./07-typescript-support/Svelte_typescript_support.md) or at [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Svelte_TypeScript).

[TypeScript support](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-repl/issues/130) is not available from the REPL yet.

The application ported to TypeScript is in the `08-next-steps` folder, you can download it with the `npx degit opensas/mdn-svelte-tutorial/08-next-steps svelte-todo` command.

## 08. Deployment and next Steps

In this final article we will look at how to deploy your application and get it online, and also share some of the resources that you should go on to, to continue your Svelte learning journey.
